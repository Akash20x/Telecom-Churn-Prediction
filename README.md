# Telecommunications Customer Churn Prediction

## Discovering which customers are most likely to churn and which will stay.

## Business Case

Telecom, a telecommunications company is interested in knowing why they're losing customers and how they can predict customers who are likely to churn so they can target marketing efforts to retain these customers. 

Since the cost of aquiring customers is much higher than the cost of maintaining them, and losing customers also means losing revenue, these efforts will increase their firm's profit and value.

## Introduction

This is a Random forest classification model for a most common dataset, Telecom Churn prediction.In this repository, I have performed the end to end Exploratory Data Analysis, and idenfitied the characteristics of the customers that are more likely to churn, and I have used them wisely to create a model, and lately, have deployed the model.
